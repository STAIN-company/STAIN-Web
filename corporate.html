      <h5 class= "heading6 mb-4 pb-4">Here you can find <span class="accent-2"> the marketing justification </span>for all the socials (<span class="accent-4">Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook</span>) we used after the social media campaign.</h5>
      
		<!-- START OF INSTAGRAM ON CORPORATE -->
	
		<h3 class="titles-carousel">INSTAGRAM</h3>
		<!-- Start of Context of Campaign and Promotional Activities on Instagram -->
      <h3 class="heading4 mt-4 accent-1">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h3>
		<h4 class="heading5">Instagram Feed/Posts</h4>
		 <p class= "heading6">For our Instagram feed we have decided to stick to our color palette, and overall style. We used the same background color in all of the posts, as well as on our website. The same fonts were used throughout our entire brand experience, and we made sure that our logo or our brand name is visible in all of our content.  We deeply incorporated our brand values, which are boldly visible with our brand colors. We added our personal experiences with our brand values as well as an explanation as to why we think those brand values add significant meaning to your life. We felt like we could create a connection with our viewers and thus, community if we made it more personal. For the illustrated posts we used a neon light element, which is also seen on our Facebook page. </p>
		<h4 class="heading5">Instagram Reels</h4>
		 <p class= "heading6">We decided to create reel/video content as well since our target group (interviews) explained that they memorize video content very well. We tried to start a little trend by making it easy for people to interact and feel incorporated into our brand, since pretty much everyone will have at least one pair of dirty shoes. Once we showed our official STAIN shoes/product on our page, we also shared an “inspiration” reel for people to know what our main goal is with these shoes. 
			Both reels perfectly fit our theme of getting dirty/messy. 
		</p>
		<h4 class="heading5">Instagram Stories</h4>
		 <p class= "heading6">We tried to interact with our followers, as well as make them aware of our new posts. We linked posts in our story’s, we put up polls or we asked them to comment on their own experience underneath our posts. We also added some extra story’s that go well with our product (for example a “Shoe Care” series of posts).</p>
      <p class="heading6">On Instagram, we really want to create a community that is open to sharing their experiences with others. We are aiming for interaction with and from young adults or anyone that comes in contact with our page. </p>
